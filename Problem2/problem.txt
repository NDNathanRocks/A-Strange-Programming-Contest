Strange Conversation
After what could be barely called a nap, Amy wakes up. Strangely, she does not hear the alarm. "I OVERSLEPT!" - she lets out a scream. Suddenly, a hand grabs her face, covering her mouth. "Be quiet, or they will come back". Flabbergasted, Amy looks around. A dreading realization comes to her mind - she is no longer home. What's more, aside from other humans, she has not seen anything like the contents of the room before in her life. After chatting with other captives, Amy learns that she has been captured by advanced aliens. Being a SCI-FI fan, she surprizes other people with her vast knowledge of what they simply called "alien stuff", and quickly becomes the local leader. Trapped inside a mysterious room, the captives start plotting their escape.

The room seems inescapable, with no visible physical barriers. The sense of entrapment grows, as Amy realizes that these alien "captors" have technology far beyond her comprehension. Amidst the scientific instruments and devices in the spaceship, she spots a peculiar alien computer, its interface marked by unfamiliar symbols and designs. However, combining her knowledge of "alien stuff" and "computer stuff" she somehow manages her way around the machine. Upon investigating, she discovers a chat interface on the alien computer. It appears that the aliens' group chat is popping off. She observes the following conversation on the screen:

It seems the Alien language has the same structure as English, but the letters are all mashed up. "Alienglish", as Amy wittily named it. She realizes that this text allows her to build a complete Alienglish-to-English decoder, that can work on any Alienglish input.

"This is priceless!", thinks Amy. Tinkering with materials in the room, she builds a clanky programmable device with a keyboard and a screen. Now what's left is the decoder program itself, and that's where you come in!

Input
Many lines consisting of uppercase letters, punctuation, spaces, and line breaks. Assume that aliens use punctuation, spaces and newlines as we do.
Output
The same string converted to an English-readable format.
Sample Input 1
        Z.!?,'-:
