Welcome to the "A Strange Programming Contest" organized by SFU's Competitive Programming Club. This is a unique and challenging competition that will test your programming skills in unconventional ways.

## About the Contest

This contest is designed to push the boundaries of your problem-solving abilities. We encountered problems that require creative thinking, clever algorithms, and, of course, a bit of strangeness.
